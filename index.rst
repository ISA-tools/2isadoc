2isa suite
==========

The 2isa suite is a collection of programs that can extract metadata out of various metabolomics file formats and write them to ISA-Tab files, creating the backbone for an ISA-Tab study that can then be shared on databases such as `MetaboLights <http://metabolights.org>`__. Right now the following source files are supported:

  .mzML
    XML-like files containing derived spectral data of mass spectrometry scans

  .imzML
    XML-like files containing metadata about imaging mass spectrometry scans

  .nmrML
    XML-like files containing derived spectral data of nuclear magnetic resonance scans
